# Library_Website
I created a College library website where you add your book and also you can search your book name in search option. It is a responsive website, so if you want to open this link in mobile you can. I gave in the website some alerts. If your book's name length and author's name length is less than 2 then your can't add your book. It shows a alert in top that 'Error: you can't add your book'.
